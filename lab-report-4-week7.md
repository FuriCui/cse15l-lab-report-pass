Part 1
First I log in to ieng6, then type “vim  TestDocSearch.java”, then put the cursor to the start parameter of getfiles. use the mouse to select a string and press D to delete. Press I to insert mode and type the new name and then press “:wq!” to save.

Part 2
I tried both ways, it works all the same way, but I prefer the second way better. Because I just edit the file and copy the text to my pc and run. The only difference is about edit in vim or text, as I think vim saves a lot of time when I am used to it and I think I would use the second way in the future.
