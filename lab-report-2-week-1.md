to scp a file “ secure copy ”, I needed to create a java class first at my local laptop. I created WhereAmI.java and typed command “javac WhereAmI.java” to create a class and run it with java WhereAmI. And it ran well. To scp I also need to enter the password and it showed I uploaded the file successfully.

Using this technology, I found out that everytime I log in or scp need no password since I created a keygen for my pc. and I created a mkdir file in the l3cui account to make the key remembered.
